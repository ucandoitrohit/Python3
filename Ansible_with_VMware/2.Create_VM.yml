# Creating a VMware Virtual Machine

# Ansible vmware_guest Module
#    community.vmware.vmware_guest

#The Ansible module vmware_guest is used to interact with your VMware infrastructure and create or manage VMware 
#  virtual machines. The full name is community.vmware.vmware_guest, which means that it is part of the collection 
#   of modules that interact with VMware and is community supported. The module vmware_guest has a very long list 
#   of parameters to customize all your needs to create a VMware vSphere virtual machine. The resource allocation 
#   list is especially extended to cover the more possible use cases. I suggest you begin with a minimum solution 
#   and then improve it little by little until you reach your expected outcome. It may be difficult to troubleshoot
#  several lines of code and options at a time. Please refer to the manual for the full list.
