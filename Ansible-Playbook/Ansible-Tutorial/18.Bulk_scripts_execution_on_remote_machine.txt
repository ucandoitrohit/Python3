#Bulk scripts execution on remote machines
# Let's say, we have a script provided by the vendor, which we need to execute on all the servers. 
#   We must copy the script on all the servers and then execute it and get the output. 
#   If we have to do this task for a huge list of servers, it will be a lot of repetitive steps.

# Module, named script. This will copy the script on the remote servers, execute it,
#  and provide the output with just a simple playbook. Last but not the least, this module works for both the 
#   Windows and the Linux machines.

#Ansible script module
#------------------------
# This module will transfer the script on the Ansible manage nodes and execute it. 
#   This module does not require Python on the remote nodes. It works for both the Linux and the Windows machines.

#Parameters for script module
#---------------------------------------
#The parameters for this module are the same as the SHELL or COMMAND modules. 
#   Therefore, we will not repeat them again. We will only discuss one parameter which was not available for the 
#   SHELL and COMMAND modules.

#decrypt
#-----------
#auto decrypt the source file using vault. The possible options are Yes and No. This is helpful 
#if we have a sensitive data available on the script and we need to encrypt it for security reasons.

Example 1:
task:
- name: Run a script with arguments
  script: /some/local/script.sh --some-argument 1234

#Explanation
#the script is available on the Ansible control node location /some/local/script.sh. 
#When we run this playbook, the script will be transferred to all the manage nodes and then be executed.
# Of course, the arguments are optional; we only add them if our script needs them.

Example 2:
task:
- name: Run a script only if file exists on the remote node
  script: /some/local/remove_file.sh --some-argument 1234
  args:
  removes: /the/removed/file.txt
# we only want to execute the script if a specific file exists on the remote nodes. 
# So, the script executes on the nodes which satisfied the condition.
