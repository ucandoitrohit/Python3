#Registered Variables
---
# The idea of registering the variables is to store the output of a task in a variable. 

- name: wget installed demo
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: wget installed
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: wget
        state: present
      register: install_result

    - name: yum printout
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: install_result
