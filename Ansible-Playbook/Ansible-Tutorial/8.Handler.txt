#The handler code is executed only if necessary. Please note the notify statement; 
# it mentions the name of the handler to run. This Playbook checks the version of the Apache http web server on all hosts.
# If an update is available, the yum module provides the upgrade process and restarts the daemon at the end.
# If an upgrade is not necessary, the handler code is not necessary.
