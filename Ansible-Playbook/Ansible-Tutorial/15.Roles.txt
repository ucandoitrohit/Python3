# Roles
#============
Directory structure for role
The following are the important folders for roles. Let's see what these folders contain, as follows:

init: Creates the required structure for a role
list: Lists roles within the path structure
search: Searches for roles on the Galaxy repository
install: Downloads and installs a role from the URL
remove: Removes a role from the system

defaults - This folder contains a main.yml file with default values for variables.
files - This folder has static files that are referenced by role's tasks.
handlers - This folder contains a main.yml with handler definitions.
Meta -  This folder contains main.yml with information about the roles, including author, license, platform, and dependencies.
tasks - This folder has a main.yml file with task definitions.
vars -  This folder has a main.yml file with role variable definitions.

Role variables
=================
The Role variables are defined in vars/main.yml

Defining role dependencies
=============================
We can expect some dependencies of roles like roles may include other roles. Dependencies are written in meta/main.yml within the role:
---
  dependencies:
   - {role: apache, port: 80}
   - {role: mariadb, dbname: addresses, admin_user: Rony}

Order of execution in role
================================

Normally, the tasks in a role is executed before the tasks of the playbook using them, but we have two solutions to override it, which are as follows:

pre_tasks are performed before the roles are applied.

post_tasks are performed after completing all roles.

 - hosts: cen_node_01
  pre_tasks:
   - debug:
    msg: 'Starting'
  roles:
   - role1
   - role2
   - role3
  tasks:
   - debug:
    msg: Execute After roles'
  post_tasks:
   - debug:
    msg: 'Last Task'
