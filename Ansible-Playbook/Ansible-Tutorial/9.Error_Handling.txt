#Ansible error handling

#Ignoring failed commands
#-----------------------------
- ignore_errors
#Example, we have written a playbook which installs Apache and then starts the service. If the installation fails, 
#   it does not make any sense to run a command, which will try to start the service. In this case, both the 
#   commands are dependent. 

- clear_host_errors 
# The default Ansible behavior is to set the host unreachable; if the host did not respond on time, and the Ansible 
#   timeout is breached – which can happen because of several issues, for example network or server utilization was 
#   high and host could not respond on time – then Ansible will remove the host from the active host.
#   The Ansible tasks will be executed on the active host only; in case we suspect there will be a false positive 
#   for the unreachable hosts, and we want to change the Ansible behavior to auto recover the unreachable host, 
#   then we have to use clear_host_errors in playbook.

Controlling what defines failure
-  failed_when
----------------

# In Ansible, we have the options to set a criterion which defines what failure means in each playbook task using the
# keyword failed_when. A list of multiple failed_when conditions are joined like a conditional statement, 
# meaning the task only fails when all the conditions are met.
