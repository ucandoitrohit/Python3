# Blocks

# Blocks are used to logically group tasks. Blocks are useful for error handling and when statements. 
#   One statement can be applied to the block, so that it affects all the tasks in the block.

# Blocks allow error handling; if a task fails, the task in the rescue task can be executed for recovery. 
#  We also have an always task, which will run regardless of success or failure of the task defined in blocks or rescue.

       state: restarted

# Ansible block option will upgrade the database. If upgrade script executed properly, 
#   the rescue block will be ignored and the always block will be executed.

# In case upgrade script failed, the rescue block will be executed, which will revert all the database changes; 
#  once it's done, the always block will restart the database. So, either block or rescue will be executed at any time,
#   but the always block will execute in any case.
